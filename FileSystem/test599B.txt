Artist Statement
My work explores the relationship between Pre-raphaelite tenets and daytime TV.
With influences as diverse as Munch and Miles Davis, new insights are crafted from both traditional and modern meanings.
Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the moment. What starts out as yearning soon becomes finessed into a cacophony of defeat, leaving only a sense of unreality and the chance of a new beginning.
As spatial derivatives become clarified through emergent and academic practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the inaccuracies of our era.
