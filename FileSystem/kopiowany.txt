Artist Statement
My work explores the relationship between the body and life as performance.
With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and Frida Kahlo, new synergies are manufactured from both explicit and implicit discourse.
Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the essential unreality of the moment. What starts out as hope soon becomes finessed into a carnival of futility, leaving only a sense of unreality and the inevitability of a new beginning.
As spatial derivatives become transformed through diligent and repetitive practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the limits of our era.
